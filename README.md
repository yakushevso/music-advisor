### About
Modern world spoils us with a wide variety of music: pop-lovers, rockers, rappers and club enthusiasts alike face a nearly infinite choice. Fortunately, there are programs that can help us find something we like and not get lost in this variety: in this project, you will write a program like this. Create a personal music advisor that makes preference-based suggestions and even shares links to new releases and featured playlists. Together with Spotify, your music advisor will be a powerful guide to the world of music.
